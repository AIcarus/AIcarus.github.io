Save `pdb` tips that are not included directly in [tutorial](http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/). Just for convenience of looking up.

How to begin debugging

* Insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` into codeï¼Œ then `python <your-program>`. Or
* python -m pdb <your-program>

Command tips

* `where` / `w`: show where you are in call stack.
* `dir()` / `locals()` / `globals()`: show all varibales.
* `continue`: continue running.
* Use `time.sleep(N)` to switch processes in PDB. Refer to [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12219231/how-to-switch-between-processes-in-pdb)
