3.5.6 summary of how to technical leadership
    1. learned from HHHHH
       and search my journal
       watch product moves, watch big vendor moves, watch big competitor moves
       watch community moves and new patches/commits/pull requests
    2. identity ecosystems, big vendors/leaders, info sources, gantner graphs
       identity research entities / conferneces / summits / scholar units
    3. code dive
       to kernel support
    4. usages in other works
       peer works
       advantanges/disadvantages/suitable scenarios and market division of each peer works
    5. opensource contribution, code reviews, and maillist updates, and their summits
       major players, notable players / contributors
    6. future movements, cutting edge works, problem to be solved
    7. market player, startups, big companies, known experts/people
       each of the player's market division & featuring
    8. build connections with people and market players
    9. public adoptions, user status and preference, what are big companies doing and using
       like the survey that openstack foundation does
    9. a full map from kernel to upper app technology hierarchy
       a global sense from technology to market to people and adoptions
       a timeline from history to future activities
    10. info source: where does the newest movement comes out from? e.g. Java - Java One
    11. market: major vendors/player, advantanges/disadvantages, customer adoptions
    12. technology news articles, such as infoq, translated papers, etc, some are good
        good blogs, major person's blogs such as Openstack cores, good company blogs
        information comes from good person & players, identify them
    13. strategic thinking
    14. blog: summary on schedulers: paper & research, public activities & social, ..., to coding details, to opensource, ...
    15. read papers, find references, find influencing works, construct the knowledge base, like doing survey
    16. good vertical social medias: such as Hacker News
    17. 用opensource技术的例子，如opstk，k8s；用tech stack的例子，如storage，云，scheduling
    18. give a few examples, on container, scheduling, cloud, java, storage, openstack, dev
    19. how HHHHH does his tech leadership? connections, with BU team, intel, mellanox, summit people, all sorts of new technologies, commitee / standard level, opensource kernel / ceph / etc commit upstream updates, communicate with peers, newest technology enabling and trends and find use,
    20. top level conference / paper publications
    21. if the newest updates are from summit, then how does the summit speaker's projects come from? I guess, from the underwater pioneer discussions, industry connections, their innovations, academic adoptions, innovation from solving production/industry problems, etc
    22. sometime watching videos (summit videos) are even more effective than reading articles.
    23. identifiy the newest protocol, kernel (NVMe) supports, movements, standard committee movements, and see how to use it into our stuff (HHHHH)
    24. need to get the big picture / landscape / global map. it is almost the most important
    25. research on new released products, new startups, new acquisitions, new financiing cases, to find out new technologies and new use cases and new market cases
    26. how is new project opportunity，new startup opportunity，new trending tech, new investment opportunity found?
        identify thetech gap of new tech，find new leverage，solve new problem，find the cutting edgeplace andadvance
        always stand at the cutting edge (fast be expert) and try to advance
        watch upstream commit， Apache foundation moves (or even further in maillists?)，us tech social media，people discuss communication，tech radar，summit
        a lot of things actually come from gaps in leading opensource stuff
        most importantly, communicate with peers, see what people are thinking
    27. 上述讲的多是如何找到“信息的源头”，但我们何时能够自己成为信息源呢？
    28. also, read research papers (e.g. from top level conferences) is a good way to obtain background information and state-of-arts
    29. 现在的微信群，如果加到专业技术圈的群里的，消息更新也是非常快的。事实上微信群能提供第一时间的高质量的信息。例如openstack的几个微信群
        另外，一些好的微信号（尤其是个人微信公众号）也能提供有用的业内更新
    30. 看investments，fundings，startup信息也是个了解market accepted tech的方法
